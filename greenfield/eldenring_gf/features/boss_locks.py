"""SPEC-PARITY Phase 3 -- region bosses (+ future dungeon sweeps).

Region bosses: the 25 major bosses (method=boss_arena) joined to greenfield ap-ids by FLAG,
pre-generated into boss_data.py (matt-free). Emitted as bossLocations {region: [ap_ids]} for kept
regions -- the data a boss-based ending goal / region-boss tracker reads.

Dungeon SWEEPS (kill a dungeon boss -> auto-grant its other checks) need a per-dungeon boss-kill
flag the backbone does NOT carry: only 22/39 minidungeons have any emevd row, and those aren't
reliably boss rewards. That trigger set requires an EMEVD enrichment pass (SPEC-PARITY.md P3); the boss-defeat FLAG per dungeon is now derived from the DarkScript EMEVD (boss_sweeps.py) and
emitted as dungeonSweepFlags {boss_flag: [member_ap_ids]}; a small client flag-watch handler
(P3b-client) grants the members on boss kill. The location-keyed dungeonSweeps variant additionally
needs a boss-reward-location join (ItemLotParam) and stays empty for now.
